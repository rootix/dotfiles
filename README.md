# dotfiles

These are my personalized dotfiles for my private MacBook.

The repository is managed by [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/), hence the possibly unfamiliar naming
scheme.

I use them as a backup and as a reference for other machines i'm on. If you get something out of
it, good for you :-)
I learned a ton from other dotfiles repositories about yabai, skhd and other tools.
